Our UI Skeleton has improved over Milestone4 as showed by the following features:
1. We have decided to switch over to Firebase as it is easier to play with data with the databases.
2. We have changed the database to a parent-child two-layer system
3. We have added a view table function
4. We are able to edit/insert/delete listings

Our two user actions are as follows:
1. The user is able to edit/insert/delete a new estate with customized input information. By clicking on "data management", the user will be able to access an editing page. By inputting all necessary information and clicking "Insert into database", the user will be able to add a new listing. By inputting all necessary information and clicking "Delete from database". By clicking on "Reset database", the user can batch erase all newly inputted information.
2. The user is able have an overview of all data in a clear table. By clicking on "GetTABLE", the users is able access all information in one single table.
