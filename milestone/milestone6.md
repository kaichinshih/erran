Our UI Skeleton has improved over Milestone5 as showed by the following features:
1. We have completed visualizing the data through Google Maps API
2. We have switched over to the "on" function; real-time manipulation of map is possible
3. We have re-designed the flow to make sure that the user experience is more seamless and straightforward.
4. We have added a simple UI design

Our data visualization can be seen in the third image from the top. Our map runs a loop to read all listing information in our database. It first reads the longitude and latitude information to display markers indicating the location of the listing. It then reads all other information and displays them in an infowindow.
