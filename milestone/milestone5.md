Our UI Skeleton has improved over Milestone4 as showed by the following features:
1. We have decided to switch over to Firebase as it is easier to play with data with the databases.
2. We have changed the database to a parent-child two-layer system
3. We have added a view table function
4. We are able to edit/insert/delete listings

Our two user actions are as follows:
1. The user is able to edit/insert/delete a new estate with customized input information.
2. The user is able to view all data in a clear table. We plan on iterating by allowing users to access all information in one single table.
