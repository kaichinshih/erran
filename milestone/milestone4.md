Our UI Skeleton has improved over Milestone3 as showed by the following features:
1. Clicking on individual properties now leads to a new text box on the same page instead of a new html page.
2. Users are now able to add and delete properties freely
3. Instead of a fake database, we now rely on an actual db file.

Addressing user privacy issues, our project utilizes freely-available data from the City of San Diego. By interacting with real-world open data, we are not capturing nor collecting user data. We will also not implement any deceptive UI techniques as our webpage only aims to provide a platform for obtaining housing data. Moreover, our team will be putting up a Privacy Policy page in the near future. We did the same for our COGS120 project.
