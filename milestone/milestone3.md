Overall, our screenshots demonstrate how our UI skeleton follows the original ideas showcased in the prototype A. However, at this moment, the homepage is is visually different from the original prototype as we have yet to integrate Google Maps API. With the future fix, we will make it easier for users to view all available options. As for the second page, we followed prototype A and came up with a page that showcases all the necessary information in one single page.
